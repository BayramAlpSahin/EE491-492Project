We present our preliminary experimentation with CNN and Autoencoder structures. CNN architecture can reach a very high accuracy rating on the recognition task in MNIST dataset without a very deep convolutional architecture. In the noise reduction task implemented through autoencoders, Fashion MNIST dataset proved to be easier to work with. In Fashion MNIST dataset, a two layer convolutional encoder and two layer decoder gets satisfying results. Yet, a similar shallow model doesn't converge in the MNIST dataset. In order to perform noise reduction in MNIST dataset, we found out that we need to increase the depth of the model. This suggests that some features might be hard to learn unless very deep arcitectures are used.
